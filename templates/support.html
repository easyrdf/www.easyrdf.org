    I would be delighted if you could supply a pull request or patch with bug reports but

<div class="section">
  <h2>Security Issues</h2>

  <p>
    If you think that you have found a security issue in EasyRdf, 
    please don't use the mailing list or the issue tracker. Instead, all 
    security issues must be sent to security [at] easyrdf.org.
    Emails sent to this address are forwarded to the development team to look at.
